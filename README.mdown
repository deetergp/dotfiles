# No Place Like ~/ #

This repo contains the dotfiles I use on nearly every computer on which I have a home folder.

## On The Shoulders of Giants ##

Nearly everything in my dotfiles was shamelessly snagged form other sources. These are some of the ones I remember:

### General ###

The general layout of this repo and `bootstrap` script came from [pengwynn's dotfiles repo](https://github.com/pengwynn/dotfiles).

### vim ###

- [Amir Salihefendic's .vimrc](http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html)
- [Steve Losh's article, _Coming Home to Vim_](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/)
- [Dr. Bunsen's article, _The Text Triumvirate_](http://www.drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate/)
- [John Long's _tilde_ repo](https://github.com/jlong/tilde/)
- [Pengwynn's _dotfiles_ repo](https://github.com/pengwynn/dotfiles)

### tmux ###

- [tmux: Productive Mouse-Free Development](http://www.amazon.com/tmux-Productive-Development-Brian-Hogan/dp/1934356964) by: Brian P.Hogan
    - This book contains a TON of useful `tmux` tips! Definitely worth reading if you are into this kind of thing.

## Spreading the Love ##

I get tons of inspiration and ideas from my good friends [Mark Shropshire](https://github.com/shrop/) & [Mark Bellaire](https://github.com/mgbellaire). Together, we run [SellDevel](http://shelldevel.net) where we share with the world the stuff we used to just geek out about on our own. If you'd like semi-regualr tips on developing at the command line, check it out at [shelldevel.net](http://shelldevel.net) or follow us on Twitter at [@shelldevel](http://twitter.com/shelldevel).
